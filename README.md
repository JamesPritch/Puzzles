# Puzzles

This is a collection of simple puzzles that I want to check mechanically.

# 27.07.25 Bellos's brainteasers in Guardian Puzzle summer special.
1. The 15 boxes
Andrew and Barbara open boxes with random prizes in, one by row and one by column. Who is more likely to find a prize first?

# 12.11.25 DTC Software Application Task.
Task:
Develop a small software application to collect, store, and display real-time readings from a simulated sensor system.

Details:
Designed and implemented a module to generate or capture live data readings from a virtual sensor source.
Build a logging component to store readings in a structured file format for later analysis.
Create a visualization module to plot the data over time and highlight any anomalies or threshold events.
Focus on clean code structure, modular design, and clear documentation to make the tool easy to extend to physical hardware inputs.
Skills demonstrated:
General-purpose programming and problem-solving
Working with data acquisition and logging workflows
Software modularity and maintainability
Visualization and basic data analysis concepts
Understanding of processes relevant to embedded and real-time systems
Assumptions:
Sensor readings are saved in a text or CSV file.
The program periodically reads this file to process or visualize data.
Useful for testing and simulation when no physical hardware is connected.

Combined Environmental Sensor Output example:
Timestamp
Temperature (°C)
Humidity (%)
Pressure (hPa)
AirQuality (Index)

There will be very likely some details that are not defined or missing - feel free to define them yourself. For example out frequency does the sensor output data into the file – you decide.
DTC is only interested to review the coding style and really looking at software requirements.
 
Have fun!
